# Insurance Claims – Executive Business Actions

## Executive Summary
Our analysis shows that claims are **not evenly distributed** across the portfolio.  
A small number of **sales channels and vehicle segments** generate a **disproportionate share of total claim costs**, threatening profitability.

Immediate action is required in **pricing, underwriting, and channel governance**.

---

## Key Findings (What We Learned)

### 1. Sales Channel Risk Concentration
- Certain sales channels generate **significantly higher total claim amounts**
- These channels are likely prioritizing volume over risk quality

**Business Implication:**  
Channel strategy is currently misaligned with loss performance.

---

### 2. Vehicle Class Drives Claim Severity
- Specific vehicle classes (e.g., SUVs / Four-Door vehicles) dominate claims across channels
- High-risk vehicle classes appear consistently, regardless of how policies are sold

**Business Implication:**  
Vehicle risk is structural and must be priced explicitly, not absorbed portfolio-wide.

---

### 3. Vehicle Size Amplifies Loss Exposure
- Larger vehicle sizes generate materially higher claim costs
- Premium differentiation does not sufficiently compensate for this risk

**Business Implication:**  
Current pricing underestimates claim severity for larger vehicles.

---

## Recommended Business Actions (What We Should Do)

### A. Pricing & Underwriting Actions (Immediate Impact)

#### 1. Introduce Vehicle-Based Risk Pricing
- Increase premiums for high-risk vehicle classes and sizes
- Apply stronger multipliers for large and SUV-type vehicles

**Expected Outcome:**  
Improved loss ratio without reducing customer count.

---

#### 2. Channel-Specific Underwriting Rules
- Tighten underwriting criteria for high-claim sales channels
- Introduce mandatory vehicle risk checks before policy approval

**Expected Outcome:**  
Reduced inflow of structurally unprofitable policies.

---

### B. Sales Channel Governance (Medium-Term)

#### 3. Incentivize Quality Over Volume
- Shift sales KPIs from policy count to **loss-adjusted profitability**
- Penalize channels with persistent high claim ratios

**Expected Outcome:**  
Better risk selection at the point of sale.

---

#### 4. Rebalance Channel Mix
- Gradually reduce reliance on high-risk channels
- Expand lower-risk channels with better claim performance

**Expected Outcome:**  
More stable and predictable claims portfolio.

---

### C. Risk Prevention & Customer Strategy

#### 5. Targeted Risk Mitigation Programs
- Offer safety incentives or training for high-risk vehicle owners
- Promote advanced safety features in underwriting discounts

**Expected Outcome:**  
Lower claim frequency without customer attrition.

---

## Strategic Takeaway for Leadership

> **Claims are not random. They are predictable, segment-driven, and manageable.**

By acting on **sales channel behavior** and **vehicle-level risk**, the company can:
- Restore profitability
- Reduce volatility
- Transition toward a genuinely data-driven insurance model

## Next Steps
1. Validate pricing impact with actuarial team
2. Pilot channel-specific rules in one region
3. Track claim reduction over 90 days
